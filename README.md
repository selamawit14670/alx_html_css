# 🎧 Headphones Landing Page - Task 0

This is **Task 0** of the ALX HTML & CSS project: building the **Header and Hero section** of a landing page based on a Figma design.

---

## 📂 Project Files for This Task

- `0-index.html` – HTML structure for the header and hero section
- `0-styles.css` – CSS styles for layout, fonts, colors, and responsiveness
- `images/` – Folder containing all image assets (e.g., logo and background)

---

## 🧱 What’s Included in the Header Section

- **Navigation bar** with logo and links:
  - What we do
  - Our results
  - Contact us
- **Hero section** with:
  - Heading: *"Headphones for the future"*
  - Paragraph describing the product
  - Call-to-action button

---

## 🎨 Design Features

- Responsive design: mobile layout activates at screen width `480px` or less
- Hero background image (`headphones_hero_1.jpg`)
- Link hover/active color: `#FF6565`
- Button hover/active effect: `opacity: 0.9`
- Content is centered with a `max-width` of `1000px`

---

## 🖼️ Image Assets Used

- `logo_headphones.png` – top-left logo
- `headphones_hero_1.jpg` – background image for hero section

These are stored inside the `images/` folder.  
Make sure to extract `images_.zip` and move the contents into that folder.

---

## 💡 Best Practices Followed

- Used **CSS variables** for colors and fonts
- Created **generic, reusable CSS class names**
- Reset default browser styling
- Clean and simple HTML structure using `div` containers
- Built from **outside to inside**, **top to bottom** as recommended
